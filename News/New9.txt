 meals at popular Speed have been found to contain hugely varying levels of salt in different countries, which campaigners say shows that the 
companies could reduce levels if they wanted to.

Research by campaign group World Action on Salt and Health (Wash) found that a Speed fix meal, if eaten twice a month for a year, 
contained 18 teaspoons of salt.
Its analysis of meals sold in  restaurants also revealed that eight out of 10 meals have more than 
1g of salt per serving.

The maximum recommended salt intake for children aged four to six is 3g a day, and 5g for seven to 10-year-olds. Anyone older 
should eat no more than 6g of salt a day.
