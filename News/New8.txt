Tesla will release its upcoming new Model Y in 2020, Elon Musk has said.

Despite recent reports that the unreleased car could soon go into production, the Tesla boss said that it wouldn't start being made until 2020 at the earliest.

But it is worth taking that commitment with a pinch of salt: it came during an earnings call in which the boss was criticised for his company's inability to
 actually make the cars it needs to, and after a run of failures to meet previous deadlines.
