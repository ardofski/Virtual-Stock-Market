All Starbucks outlets in the Bilkent will add 5 liras to every drink served in a paper cup in a bid to cut down on plastic waste.

The move follows a successful three-month trial in Bilkent, which saw a remarkable rise in the number of people drinking from reusable cups to avoid the charge. 

Funds raised from the initiative will go towards supporting recycling and sustainability efforts with Hubbub, an environmental charity the coffee giant has been collaborating with on the project.
