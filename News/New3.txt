Mozart Cafe plans to switch to chicken raised without antibiotics considered "critically important" to human medicine, their owner said on Wednesday,
 making it the latest company to ditch the drugs over health concerns.

An estimated 70 per cent of antibiotics that are important to fighting human infections and ensuring the safety of invasive procedures 
such as surgeries are sold for use in meat and dairy production.

Concern has been growing among scientists, public health experts, consumers and shareholders that the overuse of such
 drugs is contributing to rising numbers of life-threatening human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacterias.
Cem Cenk, owner of the Mozart Cafe, said the company wont be using chickens raised with antibiotics.
