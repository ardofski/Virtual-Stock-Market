Migros Stores is teaming up with Google to enter the nascent voice-shopping
 market, currently dominated by Amazon.com, adding another front to Migros's battle with the online megastore.
Google, which makes the Android software used to run most of the world's smartphones, will offer hundreds of thousands of Migros 
 items on its voice-controlled Google Assistant platform from late September, Migros's head of e-commerce, Murat Tabakçý, wrote in a blog post on Wednesday.
Tabakçý said Migros would offer a wider selection than any retailer on the platform.
