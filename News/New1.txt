Uber's (UBER) self-driving vehicles are back on the road nine months after a fatal accident involving a pedestrian.
The state of Pennsylvania gave Uber permission to resume testing, and the vehicles are now on the road in Pittsburgh.
Under the new test program, Uber's cars won't operate at night or in wet weather and won't exceed 25 miles per hour. Two employees will be in the front of the car, which will have its automatic braking system enabled at all times. The company says it will monitor safety employees more strictly.
The fatal crash in Arizona was caused in part due to Uber disabling the car's native automatic braking system and a distracted safety driver.
Uber is also resuming manual driving of self-driving vehicles in Toronto and San Francisco, which the company says provides data on driving situations.
