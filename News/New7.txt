With summer around the corner, iced coffee drinks may sound like the perfect energy-boosting treat - but in reality, they can be full of hidden sugars and calories.

Fitness and health blogger Ecemsu Pelin shared the facts about those delicious but potentially unhealthy iced beverages on her Instagram - and how you can 
swap ingredients for healthier alternatives without compromising on taste.

In a series of Instagram stories, Ecemsu, 26, informed her 633,000 followers that a grande Mocha Frappuccino from Coffee Break contains 400 calories and
 61g of sugar - and almost no coffee.
To back it up, Ecemsu shared a screenshot of a conversation with a former Coffee Break barista who wrote: “I used to work at Coffee Break and it was seriously
 the smallest little driblet of coffee. Like less than 1/10th of the cup.”
