An entire campus was left without internet access for two hours after a fire accident.
"The most significant, and longest-lasting disruption was seen in Bilkent,with a complete outage lasting for nearly 2 hours,
 followed by partial restoration of connectivity,” said Ali Hananlý, senior director of internet research and analysis at BCC.
The director of networks and international services at BCC, which heads the consortium of 19 organisations , tweeted a picture of the severed 
cable taken by workers on a maintenance vessel sent to repair it.
